- 👋 Hi, I’m @say-when.
- 👀 I’m interested in AI, Flutter, SwiftUI, Swift, and all other aspects of mobile development.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning AI (Vector DBs and LLMs) integration in the mobile space, and have become pretty handy with Flutter.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on, anything really. My day to day work keeps me busy, but collaboration might be fun.
- 📫 How to reach me: scottgrantapps@gmail.com
