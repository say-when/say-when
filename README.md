- 👋 Hi, I’m @say-when
- 👀 I’m interested in SwiftUI, Swift, and all aspects of iOS development
- 🌱 I’m currently learning SwiftUI (well, struggling against more than learning - and if you're a Swift developer of lengthy experience, you know what I'm talking about). Just started to investigate Flutter & Dart, it's quite intriguing.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on, anything really. My day to day work keeps me busy, but collaboration might be fun.
- 📫 How to reach me: scottgrantapps@gmail.com
